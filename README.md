# Hi there 👋

I used to design spaces — now I design interfaces.  
I'm currently training as a fullstack developer (React, Node, MySQL).  
Here you'll find my projects, ideas, and experiments as I learn.  
This GitHub is my studio, where everything begins with a line of code.

## 🌱 A bit more about me

I come from a background in interior design, where I learned how to combine form and function — now I apply that thinking to web development.
